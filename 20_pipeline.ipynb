    "        Cross-validation Accuracy: 0.7991, which is slightly lower than Gradient Boosting (0.8062).\n",
    "        Test Accuracy: 0.8379, higher than Gradient Boosting (0.7989).\n",
    "        Random Forest performed better on the test set, indicating that it generalizes better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Generalization:\n",
    "        Gradient Boosting had better cross-validation accuracy, but it underperformed on the test set. This suggests that it may have overfit the training data slightly during cross-validation.\n",
    "        Random Forest strikes a better balance between training and test performance, making it a more reliable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pipeline Steps:\n",
    "        Imputation: Handles missing values with the most frequent value in the dataset, ensuring that the model can process all data.\n",
    "        Encoding: One-hot encoding ensures that categorical variables are transformed into numerical format without introducing bias.\n",
    "        Model: Random Forest is robust to overfitting due to its ensemble nature, especially on datasets with a mix of numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Practicality:\n",

    "Conclusion:\n",

    "    Random Forest was chosen because of its higher test accuracy and better generalization.\n",
