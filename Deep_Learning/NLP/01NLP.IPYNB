    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Language Modeling**\n",
    "Guessing the next word in a sentence.  \n",
    "Example: \"I am going to the\" → \"park\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)**\n",
    "A way to translate or convert one set of words into another.  \n",
    "Example: \"How are you?\" → \"¿Cómo estás?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "Helping the computer focus on important words in a sentence.  \n",
    "Example: In \"I love chocolate ice cream,\" focus on \"chocolate\" and \"ice cream\" to know what is loved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **Transformer**\n",
    "A smart model that understands long sentences better.  \n",
    "Example: Used in tools like Google Translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**\n",

    "# BERT and GPT: Explained Simply\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is it?**  \n",
    "  BERT is a model that understands text by looking at the entire sentence from both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left). It focuses on understanding the meaning of words in context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:  \n",
    "  - Reads sentences **bidirectionally** (both ways).  \n",
    "  - Great for understanding and tasks like answering questions, finding important parts of a sentence, and filling in blanks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "  Sentence: \"I went to the ___ to withdraw money.\"  \n",
    "  BERT predicts: **\"bank\"** (not riverbank, but money bank).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uses**:  \n",
    "  - Search engines (e.g., Google Search).  \n",
    "  - Question answering.  \n",
    "  - Text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is it?**  \n",
    "  GPT is a model that generates text. It predicts the next word in a sentence by reading it one word at a time (left-to-right). It’s focused on creating fluent and natural-sounding text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:  \n",
    "  - Reads sentences in one direction (left-to-right).  \n",
    "  - Excels at generating stories, essays, or conversations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "  Prompt: \"Once upon a time in a small village,\"  \n",
    "  GPT continues: \"there lived a kind old man who loved telling stories to children.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uses**:  \n",
    "  - Text generation (stories, articles, or scripts).  \n",
    "  - Chatbots (like ChatGPT!).  \n",
    "  - Creative writing.\n",
