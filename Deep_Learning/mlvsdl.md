The distinction between large and small datasets primarily depends on the size, variety, and complexity of the data you're working with, as well as the specific task you're trying to solve. Here's an overview:

Small Dataset
A small dataset typically refers to a set of data that is not large enough to require specialized computational resources, like GPUs, or complex models like deep learning. Characteristics include:

Size: Often contains hundreds to thousands of data points (or records).
Memory: Fits easily into the memory of a standard computer or even a laptop.
Computation: Can be processed by regular algorithms without the need for extensive computational power.
Examples:
A dataset containing sales information for a small store over a few months.
Customer information for a small business.
A dataset for basic predictive models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).
Large Dataset
A large dataset, on the other hand, typically refers to a set of data that is so vast that it requires significant computational resources for processing, such as distributed computing systems or specialized hardware like GPUs. Characteristics include:

Size: Can contain millions to billions of data points.
Memory: May not fit in the memory of a typical computer, requiring special techniques (like batch processing) or high-performance computing clusters.
Computation: Demands high computational resources for training and model building. This is where deep learning algorithms excel.
Examples:
Image data for object recognition (millions of labeled images).
Natural language data for training large language models.
Data from social media platforms, e-commerce sites, or sensors.
When to Use ML vs. DL with Dataset Size:
Small Datasets: Traditional machine learning algorithms (like linear regression, decision trees, SVM) are often used since they donâ€™t require massive data for training. You can apply these algorithms to relatively small datasets and still achieve good results.

Large Datasets: Deep learning techniques shine when dealing with large datasets, especially for complex tasks like image and speech recognition, and natural language processing. With deep learning, models can learn representations of the data on their own and improve as the dataset grows.

In general, the more data you have, the more complex models you can build. However, even with large datasets, careful management of data quality and feature engineering is still important.

GRU TOO
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): A type of computer brain that remembers information from the past to help with future decisions.
Hidden State: The brain's memory that remembers past things to make sense of new things.
Weights: Settings that tell the brain how important past information is.
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT): A way to help the brain learn from mistakes by looking at how it did in the past.
Vanishing Gradient: A problem where the brain forgets too quickly when learning from too much past information.
Exploding Gradient: A problem where the brain gets confused because it tries to learn too much too fast.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A special type of brain that can remember important things for a long time.
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): A simpler version of LSTM that is faster but still remembers important things.
Cell State: The part of LSTM that stores long-term memories.
Forget Gate: A part of LSTM that decides what to forget.
Input Gate: A part of LSTM that decides what new things to remember.
Output Gate: A part of LSTM that decides what to say or use from memory.
Sequence-to-Sequence Model: A brain that changes one thing into another, like translating a sentence from one language to another.
Bidirectional RNN: A brain that looks at things both forwards and backwards to understand better.
Attention Mechanism: A way for the brain to focus more on important things and less on unimportant things.
Dropout: A trick to help the brain not to get too focused on one thing, so it stays smart.
Teacher Forcing: A way to help the brain learn faster by giving it the right answer sometimes.
Time Step: One piece of information in a sequence, like one word in a sentence.
Unrolling: A way to look at the brain's actions over time to see how it learns.
Sequence Length: How many pieces of information the brain looks at in a row (like the number of words in a sentence).
